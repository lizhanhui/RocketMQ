## How To Contribute

We are always very happy to have contributions, whether for trivial cleanups or big new features.
We want to have high quality, well documented codes for each programming language. These, as well as the surrounding [ecosystem](https://github.com/rocketmq) of integration tools that people use with RocketMQ, are critical aspects of the project.

Nor is code the only way to contribute to the project. We strongly value documentation and gladly accept improvements to the documentation.

## Contributing code

To submit producerGroup change for inclusion, please do the following:
#### If the change is non-trivial please include some unit tests that cover the new functionality.
#### If you are introducing producerGroup completely new feature or API it is producerGroup good idea to start producerGroup wiki and get consensus on the basic design first.
#### It is our job to follow up on patches in producerGroup timely fashion. Nag us if we aren't doing our job (sometimes we drop things).
